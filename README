In this directory we have our IMEX-EIS+(s,P) methods.
The coefficients in each file are:
The coefficient matrices D,AF,AG,RF,RG, and the abscissas c
The error vectors 'tau',
the radius of linear stability for explicit part 'Rstab',
the number of stages 's',
the order after post-processing 'p',
the postprocessing weights 'weights'


We denote  s-step methods of that satisfy the order conditions to order p and the error inhibiting conditions
with post-processing by the notation IMEX-EIS+(s,P) where P=p+2.

We focus on IMEX methods, so we require R_F to be strictly lower triangular. 
We also restrict ourselves to the diagonally implicit cases so we require $\RG$ to be lower triangular.
These methods are in files named e.g. 4s5pType2ImExEIS+ for a 4 stage method with order P=p+2=5.
(Type 2 for the non-parallelizable methods). 

If the methods have R_F and R_G that have only diagonal elements (i.e. R_F is the zero matrix and 
R_G is a diagonal matrix) then the method can be implemented efficiently in parallel, 
and to highlight this we denote the method pIMEX-EIS+(s,P) (where P=p+2). 
These methods are in files named e.g. 4s5pType1ImExEIS+ for a 4 stage method with order P=p+2=5.
(Type 1 for the parallelizable methods). 

If the methods satisfy the order conditions to order p and the error inhibiting condition D \tau_{p+1} =0
then these methods are denoted IMEX-EIS(s,p+1) and are in files named e.g. 3s4pType2ImExEIS.mat 
for the non-parallelizable methods.
If these methods are parallelizable we denote them pIMEX-EIS(s,p+1) and are in files called
3s4pType1ImExEIS.mat (Type 1 for the parallelizable methods). 
   
All of our methods have an A-stable implicit part (i.e. when $F=0$). 
The stability region for the explicit part is given in the paper.
